Council Framework Decision on money laundering, the investigation, the freezing, seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime (10232/2000 – C5-0393/2000 – 2000/0814(CNS)) -- LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime (10232/2000 – C5‑0393/2000 – 2000/0814(CNS))\nTranslation number 32 \n The proposal is amended as follows: -- The initiative is amended as follows:\nTranslation number 33 \n It is necessary to take into account the conclusions of the Presidency of the European Council in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999. -- Account should be taken of the Presidency conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999.\nTranslation number 34 \n It is necessary to take into account the conclusions of the Presidency of the European Council in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 and the conclusions of the Presidency of the European Council in Vienna on 11 and 12 December 1998. -- Account should be taken of the Presidency conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 , and of the Presidency conclusions of the European Council meeting in Vienna on 11 and 12 December 1998 .\nTranslation number 35 \n It is easy to avoid pointing out that the European Council in Vienna – particularly in Presidency Conclusions Nos 83, 84 and 88 – has already referred to the need to create a European area of justice and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. -- Mention should be made of the fact that the Vienna European Council, specifically Presidency conclusions 83, 84 and 88, had already pointed to the need for a European judicial area and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.\nTranslation number 36 \n (Amendment 2) Recital 2a (new) -- (Amendment 2 ) Recital 2a (new)\nTranslation number 37 \n The European Council considers it necessary to provide joint police and judicial resources to ensure that there are no hiding places for criminals or the proceeds of crime in the Union. -- The European Council considers the joint mobilisation of police and judicial resources to be necessary in order to guarantee that there is no hiding place for criminals or the proceeds of crime within the Union.\nTranslation number 38 \n The text is a verbatim copy of the second sentence of Conclusion No 6 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999. -- This text is taken from the second sentence of conclusion 6 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999.\nTranslation number 39 \n We believe it is important that this sentence be included in this framework decision, since one of the reasons for the decision is exactly the same as the conclusion cited above. -- We consider it important that it should be included in the present framework decision, because one of its motivations is based on the conclusions quoted above.\nTranslation number 40 \n (Amendment 3) Recital 2b (new) -- (Amendment 3 ) Recital 2b (new)\nTranslation number 41 \n The European Council considers that, with regard to national criminal law, efforts to agree on common definitions, constituent elements and sanctions should initially focus on a limited number of particularly relevant areas, such as financial crime. -- The European Council considers that, with regard to national criminal law, efforts to agree on common definitions, incriminations and sanctions should be focused in the first instance on a limited number of sectors of particular relevance, such as financial crime.\nTranslation number 42 \n At its meeting in Vienna on 11 and 12 December 1998, the European Council called for the creation of a European area of justice in its Conclusion 84. -- The Vienna European Council of 11 and 12 December 1998 called, in conclusion 84, for the creation of a European judicial area.\nTranslation number 43 \n In line with this line and in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 set out in Conclusion 48 the first steps to be taken in the field of criminal law: the laws of the Member States must be progressively approximated, although in particularly relevant areas such as money laundering and other criminal offences,  which are the subject of this proposal for a Framework Decision. -- Following on from that appeal, and in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, conclusion 48 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 described the first steps to be taken in the area of criminal law, involving the gradual approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States, starting with sectors of particular relevance such as money laundering and the remaining crimes referred to in the present proposal for a framework decision.\nTranslation number 44 \n (Amendment 4) Recital 2c (new) -- (Amendment 4 ) Recital 2c (new)\nTranslation number 45 \n The European Council notes that money laundering is at the heart of organised crime. -- The European Council notes that money laundering is at the very heart of organised crime.\nTranslation number 46 \n Wherever it occurs, it should be eradicated. -- It should be rooted out wherever it occurs.\nTranslation number 47 \n The European Council is determined to ensure that concrete steps are taken to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. -- The European Council is determined to ensure that concrete steps are taken to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.\nTranslation number 48 \n The text is a verbatim copy of Conclusion 51 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999; this conclusion must be included in the content of the framework decision, so that the framework decision makes it clear to the citizen and to all interested parties the reasons for its creation. -- This text is a word-for-word transcription of conclusion 51 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999, which should be included in the content of the framework decision in order to make the underlying reasons for the initiative clear to the public, and to anyone interested in the matter.\nTranslation number 49 \n (Amendment 5) Article 1, point (a) -- (Amendment 5 ) Article 1(a)\nTranslation number 50 \n (a) Article 2, provided that the offence is punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a period not exceeding one year. -- (a) Article 2, in so far as the offence is punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order for a maximum of more than one year .\nTranslation number 51 \n (a) Article 2, provided that the offence is punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a period not exceeding six months. -- (a) Article 2, in so far as the offence is punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order for a maximum of more than six months .\nTranslation number 52 \n If the measures permitting the seizure of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or property, the value of which corresponds to those proceeds, can be applied exclusively to those offences which can be punished with a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of more than one year, the consequence is that the instrumentalities and proceeds or equivalent property derived from criminal offences:  which are subject to a lesser penalty, cannot be confiscated. -- If the measures allowing the confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds or assets whose value corresponds to that of the proceeds can be applied only to offences punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order for a maximum of more than one year, it will be impossible to confiscate instrumentalities and proceeds or assets of an equivalent value in the case of offences punishable by a lesser sentence.\nTranslation number 53 \n It is clear that it is practically impossible for the authorities of the Member States to cooperate internationally in the seizure of instrumentalities and proceeds of &#39;minor&#39; crime. -- Account has been taken of the fact that it would in practice be impossible for Member State authorities to cooperate internationally in the confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from &#39;minor&#39; offences.\nTranslation number 54 \n For this reason, it is considered that the measures of seizure must apply to instrumentalities and proceeds of crime punishable by imprisonment or a detention order restricting liberty for a maximum period of more than six months. -- Consequently, confiscation measures should apply to instrumentalities and proceeds from offences punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order for a maximum of more than six months.\nTranslation number 55 \n Otherwise, there would be a considerable margin of impunity, which would be indefensible in an area of justice which, in view of the facts and the demands of European citizens, must be genuinely &#39;European&#39; and borderless. -- Otherwise, a wide margin of impunity would be created which would be unjustifiable in a judicial area which circumstances and citizens demand should be genuinely &#39;European&#39; and border-free.\nTranslation number 56 \n (Amendment 6) Article 1, point (b) -- (Amendment 6 ) Article 1(b)\nTranslation number 57 \n (b) Article 6 . -- (b) Article 6, in so far as serious offences are concerned.\nTranslation number 58 \n In any case, offences shall include offences punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of more than six months or, in States whose legal system provides for a minimum sentence, by a custodial sentence or a detention order for at least more than three months. -- (b) Article 6, including in any event offences which are punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order for a maximum of more than six months and , as regards those States which have a minimum threshold for offences in their legal system, offences punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order for a minimum of more than three months.\nTranslation number 59 \n It seems indefensible that some Member States should not be able to consider as criminal offences for their territory acts of money laundering which have been committed intentionally and which are listed in Article 6(a) of Convention No 106 of the Council of Europe of 8 November 1990. -- It is unacceptable that some Member States should be able to consider the establishment as offences of intentionally committed money laundering activities set out in subparagraph (a) of Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention No 106 of 8 November 1990 to be inapplicable in their territory.\nTranslation number 60 \n In any event, however, it is considered that Member States may punish at least the offences referred to in Article 6(a) which are punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order of at least more than six months in some legal systems or at least more than three months in other legal systems:  should be regarded as criminal offences of money laundering. -- In any event, states should at least treat as money laundering activities the offences set out in Article 6(a) which are punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum of six months, in some legal systems, or a minimum duration of more than three months, in the remaining legal systems.\nTranslation number 61 \n Otherwise, the proceeds of a wide range of crimes that can be classified as relatively serious cannot be confiscated in other countries of the Union. -- Otherwise, it would not be possible for the proceeds from a range of fairly significant crimes to be confiscated in other EU countries.\nTranslation number 62 \n On the other hand, the conjunction &#34;or&#34; has been replaced by the conjunction &#34;and&#34; in order to bring about greater precision in terms of language and meaning; in this way, an attributive sentence was created instead of a sentence implying a separation, which would mean that one of the parts of the sentence (and thus one of the court systems) would become effective to the exclusion of the other. -- In addition, the conjunction &#39;or&#39; has been replaced by &#39;and&#39; with a view to greater linguistic and semantic precision, creating a copulatory rather than a disjunctive clause, which presupposed that one of the clauses (one of the legal systems) would come into effect at the expense of the other.\nTranslation number 63 \n However, if the two legal systems are compatible, the two parts of the sentence that refer to them must be connected by means of the conjunction &#34;and&#34;, which means a pure addition that coincides with the concrete reality that is to be expressed. -- However, if the two legal systems are compatible, the two clauses referring to them should be joined using the conjunction &#39;and&#39;, suggesting a simple concept of addition, which tallies with the situation it is intended to describe.\nTranslation number 64 \n (Amendment 7) Article 2 -- (Amendment 7 ) Article 2\nTranslation number 65 \n Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 6(1)(a) and (b) of the 1990 Convention, as set out in Article 1(b) of this Framework Decision, are punishable by custodial sentences not exceeding five years. -- Each Member State shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 6(1)(a) and (b) of the 1990 Convention, as they result from the Article 1(b) of this Framework Decision, are punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum of not less than five years.\nTranslation number 66 \n Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 6(1)(a) and (b) of the 1990 Convention, as set out in Article 1(b) of this Framework Decision, are punishable by custodial sentences not exceeding four years. -- Each Member State shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 6(1)(a) and (b) of the 1990 Convention, as they result from the Article 1(b) of this Framework Decision, are punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum of not less than four years.\nTranslation number 67 \n Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 6(1)(c) and (d) of the 1990 Convention, as set out in Article 1(b) of this Framework Decision, are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. -- Each Member State shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 6(1)(c) and (d) of the 1990 Convention, as they result from Article 1(b) of this Framework Decision, are punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum of not less than two years.\nTranslation number 68 \n Since the offence of money laundering can be punished with custodial sentences, the duration of which varies considerably between some States of the Union (the penalties range from one and a half years to fourteen years for the same offence), it is considered that the proposed threshold of four years is more in line with reality, as some States will have to amend their criminal legislation. -- Bearing in mind that the offence of money laundering is punished by deprivation of liberty the duration of which varies widely among EU countries, ranging from one and a half years to 14 years for the same offence, the proposed threshold of four years is considered to take greater account of the actual circumstances, given that some countries will have to change their criminal law.\nTranslation number 69 \n Furthermore, there is no justification whatsoever for the fact that the offences of money laundering referred to in Article 6(c) and (d) of the 1990 Convention should not be subject to a uniform level of penalties on the territory of the European Union, as recommended by the Tampere European Council in its Conclusion 55. -- Likewise, there is no justification for failing to ensure uniform penalties for money laundering offences defined in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of Article 6 of the 1990 Convention throughout the territory of the European Union, as recommended in conclusion 55 of the Tampere European Council.\nTranslation number 70 \n (Amendment 8) Article 3 -- (Amendment 8 ) Article 3\nTranslation number 71 \n Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that its laws, regulations and procedural provisions on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime allow for the confiscation of property whose value corresponds to those proceeds, both in purely domestic proceedings and in proceedings initiated at the request of another Member State, including requests for the enforcement of foreign confiscation orders. -- Each Member State shall take the necessary steps to ensure that its legislation and procedures on the confiscation of the proceeds from crime also allow for the confiscation of property the value of which corresponds to such proceeds, both in purely domestic proceedings and in proceedings instituted at the request of another Member State, including requests for the enforcement of foreign confiscation orders.\nTranslation number 72 \n However, Member States may exempt the confiscation of property whose value corresponds to the proceeds of crime in cases where that value would be less than EUR 4,000. -- However, Member States may exclude the confiscation of property the value of which corresponds to the proceeds from crime in cases in which that value would be less than EUR 4 000 .\nTranslation number 73 \n The terms &#34;property&#34;, &#34;income&#34; and &#34;confiscation&#34; have the same meanings as in Article 1 of the 1990 Convention. -- The words &#39;property&#39;, &#39;proceeds&#39; and &#39;confiscation&#39; shall have the same meaning as in Article 1 of the 1990 Convention.\nTranslation number 74 \n Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, at least in cases where the proceeds cannot be seized, its laws, regulations and procedures relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime allow for the confiscation of property the value of which corresponds to those proceeds, both in purely domestic proceedings and in proceedings initiated at the request of another Member State, including the  Requests for enforcement of foreign confiscation orders can be initiated. -- Each Member State shall take the necessary steps to ensure that its legislation and procedures on the confiscation of the proceeds from crime also allow , at least in cases in which the proceeds cannot be seized, for the confiscation of property the value of which corresponds to such proceeds, both in purely domestic proceedings and in proceedings instituted at the request of another Member State, including requests for the enforcement of foreign confiscation orders.\nTranslation number 75 \n However, Member States may exempt the confiscation of property whose value corresponds to the proceeds of crime in cases where that value would be less than EUR 2,500. -- However, Member States may exclude the confiscation of property the value of which corresponds to the proceeds from crime in cases in which that value would be less than EUR 2 500 .\nTranslation number 76 \n The terms &#34;property&#34;, &#34;income&#34; and &#34;confiscation&#34; have the same meanings as in Article 1 of the 1990 Convention. -- The words &#39;property&#39;, &#39;proceeds&#39; and &#39;confiscation&#39; shall have the same meaning as in Article 1 of the 1990 Convention.\nTranslation number 77 \n On the one hand, it is necessary to clarify that the confiscation of property whose value corresponds to the proceeds of the crime will always be an alternative measure that can only be used if it is impossible to seize the proceeds of the crime. -- It should be specified that the confiscation of property of an equivalent value to the proceeds from crime will always be an alternative measure which will only be used where it is impossible to seize the actual proceeds.\n\n***
